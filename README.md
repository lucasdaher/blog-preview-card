## My process

I started the project with HTML creating all the necessary divisions and classes and then I styled it with css and aligned it using Flexbox.

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to manipulate the **flexbox** in another type of situation and align the card to the center of the screen regardless of the resolution, making it **responsive**.

### Continued development

Regarding the project, I want to continue delving into responsiveness and flexboxing.

I get a lot of inspiration from a content creator called **ASMR Prog** ([YouTube ASMR Prog](https://www.youtube.com/@AsmrProg)). Some of his content, even if it is unexplained, ended up helping me at the beginning when I was learning and to this day it has been helping and influencing me a lot.
